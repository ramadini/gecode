# G-Strings - Gecode with String Variables

![Gecode](images/gecode-logo-100.png "Gecode")

Gecode is an open source C++ toolkit for developing
constraint-based systems and applications. Gecode provides a
constraint solver with state-of-the-art performance while being
modular and extensible.

This repository contains __G-Strings__ solver, an extension of Gecode enabling 
string variables and constraints based on the _dashed string_ representation.
We refer to [1,2,3,4,5,6] for more details.

## Installation

To install G-Strings:

1. move into ```gecode``` folder

2. ```./configure``` with ```--enable-stringvars``` option enabled.

3. ```make```

4. ```sudo make install```

Note that C++ 11 is needed. If you want to perform some sanity checks on string 
variables run the script ```run-tests``` in ```gecode/string/tests``` folder.

## MiniZinc support

G-Strings can solve problems encoded in [MiniZinc](http://www.minizinc.org/) 
language. The support for string variables in MiniZinc is still in progress and 
not part of the official release (for more information about MiniZinc with 
strings, please see [1]).

You can solve a MiniZinc model with strings ```M.mzn``` (together with optional 
data ```D.dzn```) in one step:

    $ mzn-gstrings M.mzn [D.dzn]       (1)
   
or in two steps:
   
    $ mzn2fzn-gstrings M.mzn [D.dzn]   (2)
    $ fzn-gstrings M.fzn              

In particular, (2) converts ```M.mzn``` into a FlatZinc instance ```M.fzn``` 
(this is the _F^{str}_ conversion described in [1]). If you wish to decompose 
```M.mzn``` into a FlatZinc instance _not_ containing string variables, use:

    $ mzn2fzn-str --stdlib-dir gecode/flatzinc M.mzn [D.dzn]
  
and then solve the corresponding FlatZinc instance, where string variables and 
constraints are translated into corresponding integer variables and constraints.
Note that this translation (i.e., the _F^{int}_ conversion of [1]) can take a 
long time and, although supporting all the constraints of [1], does not handle 
all the string constraints supported by G-Strings. This translation is defined 
in ```gecode/flatzinc/std/nostrings.mzn``` library.
